Data integration has long been a persistent challenge for enterprises. Traditional data integration methods are often cumbersome and inefficient, struggling to meet the demands of complex business scenarios and large-scale data processing. However, with the launch of the QEasy Cloud Data Integration Platform (hereinafter referred to as QEasy Cloud) by Guangdong QEasy Cloud Software Technology Co., Ltd., enterprises can finally make significant progress in addressing this issue. Leveraging its patented technologies and powerful functionalities, QEasy Cloud achieves non-intrusive incremental capture, high-speed synchronization performance, multi-source heterogeneous data conversion, and user-friendly visual operation and maintenance, thereby providing an effective solution for enterprise digital transformation.
As an independently developed data integration platform, QEasy Cloud boasts prominent core functions. Its patented non-intrusive incremental capture technology enables high-speed and efficient synchronization of incremental data from source databases without compromising the databases’ reading performance—an essential feature for enterprises requiring real-time incremental data analysis. Additionally, QEasy Cloud supports the conversion of multi-source heterogeneous data, covering major mainstream databases and big data platforms such as Oracle, MySQL, and GreenPlum, as well as interconnection with data products from Alibaba Cloud and Huawei. This versatility has made it widely applicable across various industries.

QEasy Cloud’s effectiveness has been proven in practical application scenarios. For a tax authority, it resolved the pain point of cumbersome and inefficient daily data synchronization and sorting, boosting work efficiency by over threefold. A large state-owned enterprise, by adopting QEasy Cloud’s non-intrusive incremental capture technology, successfully achieved high-speed synchronization of more than 30 million pieces of incremental data per day—its performance exceeding the industry average by over 10 times—greatly enhancing the enterprise’s data analysis efficiency.

QEasy Cloud possesses five core advantages: it supports one-click access to more than 150 types of data sources; a single working node can achieve a processing capacity of up to 60MB/S, with cluster deployment enabling near-linear performance improvement as nodes increase; it adopts non-intrusive incremental data acquisition without the need for agent installation; it features a user-friendly visual operation and maintenance interface that requires no coding; and it ensures high reliability through multi-point deployment and breakpoint resumption. In summary, QEasy Cloud provides enterprises with a reliable and efficient solution to address data integration challenges, playing a pivotal role in advancing their digital transformation.
